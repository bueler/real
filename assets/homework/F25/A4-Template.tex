\begin{problem} % Problem 22
If $f:A\to B$ has an inverse function then $f$ is onto and $f$ is one-to-one.
\end{problem}

% PLEASE READ:  Recall that g:B->A is an inverse function of f:A->B if g(f(a))=a for all a in A and if f(g(b))=b for all b in B.  You will want to write separate paragraphs in your proof for the two results, something like "First, to prove $f$ is onto we ..." and then "To prove $f$ is one-to-one ..."

\begin{proof}
% FILL IN

% PLEASE READ:  This following problem is part of Exercise 1.5.9.  To get started on part (a), think of the number as $x$.  Squaring or cubing of $x$ is a route to a polynomial equation for which $x$ is a root.  For part (b), one way is to use the fact that every polynomial has a finite number of roots, and then the fact, proved in class, that the union of a (countable) sequence of finite sets is countable.  For part (c) you can use Theorem 1.5.8 (ii) on the result in (b).

\begin{problem} % Problem 23
A real number $x\in\RR$ is called \emph{algebraic} if there exists $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n-1}, a_n \in \ZZ$, not all zero, so that
	$$a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0$$
That is, a real number is algebraic if it is a root of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The numbers $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt[3]{2}$, and $\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}$ are algebraic.

\begin{proof}
% FILL IN
\end{proof}

\item For fixed $n\in\NN$, let $A_n$ be the set of algebraic numbers which are roots of polynomials, with integer coefficients, of degree $n$.  Then $A_n$ is countable.

\begin{proof}
% FILL IN
\end{proof}

\item The set of all algebraic numbers is countable.

\begin{proof}
% FILL IN

\begin{problem} % Problem 24
There is an onto function $f:(0,1) \to S$ where $S=\{(x,y)\,:\,0<x,y<1\}$ is the unit square in the plane $\RR^2$.
\end{problem}

% PLEASE READ:  My hint is to start with $u\in (0,1)$ and $v\in (0,1)$ and consider their decimal expansions.  How might you combine the decimal expansions to generate one number in $(0,1)$?  Use this idea to define $x$ so that $f(x)=(u,v)$.  Of course, the plane $\RR^2$ is the set of pairs $(u,v)$ where $u$ and $v$ are any real numbers, so $S$ is just the part of the plane where each coordinate has a decimal expansion $0.b_1 b_2 b_3 \dots$ starting with zero.  Note that there is no claim that this function $f$ is continuous, but you should show it is well-defined and onto.  This function is a bit surprising because $S$ would seem to be so much larger than $(0,1)$.

% PLEASE READ:  For the following problem prove the limit directly using Definition 2.2.3.  Start your proof with ``Let $\eps>0$.  '' as shown.  However, you should do some calculations first so that you know how to choose $N$ from $\eps$ in the Definition and then complete the proof.  In (c), use the fact that $|\sin n|\le 1$; you do not have to prove this.

\begin{problem} % Problem 25
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{2n+1}{5n+3} = \frac{2}{5}$

\begin{proof}
Let $\eps>0$.  % FILL IN
\end{proof}

\item $\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{2n^2}{n^3 + 1} = 0$

\begin{proof}
Let $\eps>0$.  % FILL IN
\end{proof}

\item $\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\sin(n)}{\sqrt{n}} = o$

\begin{proof}
Let $\eps>0$.  % FILL IN
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}


% PLEASE READ:  For each part, either give an example, with justification, or prove that the request is impossible.  Edit the statements so that it is clear what you are doing, and insert a proof environment if appropriate.

\begin{problem} % Problem 26
\begin{enumerate}
\item A sequence with an infinite number of ones that does not converge to one.

\bigskip
\item A sequence with an infinite number of ones that converges to a limit not equal to one.

\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem} % Problem 27
Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence that converges to $x$.  Suppose $p(x)$ is a polynomial.  Then
	$$\lim_{n\to\infty} p(x_n) = p(x).$$
\end{problem}

% PLEASE READ:  Prove this using the algebraic limit theorem (Theorem 2.3.3).  You will want to induct on the degree of the polynomial.  You can assume $p(x)$ is either in standard form or in Horner's nested form.

\begin{proof}
% FILL IN
\end{proof}


\begin{problem} % Problem 28
Consider three sequences $(x_n)$, $(y_n)$, and $(z_n)$ for which $x_n \le y_n \le z_n$ for each $n$.  If $x_n \to \ell$ and $z_n \to \ell$ then $y_n \to \ell$.
\end{problem}

% PLEASE READ:  This is the squeeze theorem.  This is not just an application of the order limit theorem (Theorem 2.3.4) because you need to prove that $\lim y_n$ exists.  I would just prove from the original Definition 2.2.3.

\begin{proof}
% FILL IN
