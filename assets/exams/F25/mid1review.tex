Midterm Exam 1 is \emph{closed book} and \emph{closed notes}.  No technology is allowed.  Please bring nothing but a writing implement.

The Exam will cover sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 2.2, and 2.3 of the textbook.\footnote{S.~Abbott, \emph{Understanding Analysis}, 2nd edition, Springer Press 2015}  The questions on the Exam will be of these types: prove propositions, state definitions and axioms, state theorems, and give examples with certain properties.  You are expected to use reasonable and common notation; feel free to define your terms for clarity.

This Review Guide list \emph{specific material that might appear on the exam}.  Material which is \emph{significantly different} from what is listed below will \emph{not} appear.  My goal is to only include topics that have appeared on homework and in lecture, and closely related things.  You might be asked to state and prove the squeeze theorem for sequences, for example.  However, I will \emph{not} ask you to ``state theorem 1.4.3,'' or anything like that which would require remembering locations in the book.  (Numbers are listed below for easy of locating.)

\emph{Strongly recommended}:  Get together with other students and work through this Review Guide.  Be honest with yourself about what you can easily prove, versus what you should think harder about and/or practice.  Talk it through and learn!

\noindent \textbf{Definitions}.  Be able to state and use the definition:
\begin{itemize}
\item natural numbers $\NN$, integers $\ZZ$, rational numbers $\QQ$, irrational number
\item \emph{all definitions in section 1.2:} set union, set intersection, empty set, disjoint, set inclusion, set complement, function, domain of a function, range of a function, absolute value function, triangle inequality
\item one-to-one function, onto function, bijection
\item upper bound, lower bound, bounded above, bounded below (for real sets)
\item $\sup A$, $\inf A$ for a real set $A$
\item maximum, minimum for a real set
\item a subset is dense in $\RR$
\item finite set, infinite set
\item countable set, uncountable set
\item $A\sim B$: the sets $A,B$ have the same cardinality
\item power set of a set
\item algebraic real number (Exercise 1.5.9)
\item real sequence
\item a real sequence converges ($\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = a$) or diverges
\item $\eps$-neighborhood of $a$
\item bounded sequence
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Concepts}.  Of course, you will be required to prove things, including one-way implications ($P\implies Q$) and equivalences ($P\iff Q$).  For the latter goal one generally proves each direction in turn, and you are expected to make it clear which direction is which.  Similarly, you might be asked to show set inclusion ($A \subseteq B$) or set equality ($A=B$), and for the latter one often shows inclusion both ways.

In addition, be able to use these proof techniques when appropriate:
\begin{itemize}
\item negate a proposition including ``for all'' and ``there exists'' quantifiers
\item proof by contradiction
\item proof by mathematical induction
\end{itemize}
and be able to state
\begin{itemize}
\item the axiom of completeness
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\newcommand{\pne}{\hfill {\footnotesize $\leftarrow$ \textbf{proof not expected}}}
\noindent \textbf{Theorems}.  Be able to use and prove\footnote{Except if I say \textbf{proof not expected}, of course.  But please read and understand these proofs!} these theorems.
\begin{itemize}
\item there is no rational number whose square is 2 (Thm 1.1.1)
\item triangle inequality (Example 1.2.5)
\item two real numbers are equal if and only if \dots (Thm 1.2.6)
\item if $f:\RR\to\RR$ is a function and $A,B$ are real subsets then $f(A\cup B) = f(A) \cup f(B)$ and $f(A\cap B) \subseteq f(A) \cap f(B)$ (Exercise 1.2.7)
\item equivalent statement of $s=\sup A$ using $\eps>0$ (Lem 1.3.8)
\item nested interval property (Thm 1.4.1)
\item Archimedean properties (Thm 1.4.2)
\item density of $\QQ$ in $\RR$ (Thm 1.4.3)
\item there exists $\alpha\in\RR$ so that $\alpha^2=2$ (Thm 1.4.5) \pne
\item $\QQ$ is countable (Thm 1.5.6(i))
\item $\RR$ is uncountable, \emph{via nested interval} (Thm 1.5.6(ii)) \pne
\item if $A\subseteq B$ and $B$ is countable \dots (Thm 1.5.7)
\item countable union of finite sets is countable
\item finite union of countable sets is countable (Thm 1.5.8(i))
\item countable union of countable sets is countable (Thm 1.5.8ii) \pne
\item open interval $(0,1)$ is uncountable (Thm 1.6.1)
\item Cantor's theorem (Thm 1.6.2) \pne
\item limits are unique (Thm 2.2.7)
\item convergent sequences are bounded (Thm 2.3.2)
\item algebraic limit theorem (Thm 2.3.3)
\item order limit theorem (Thm 2.3.4)
\end{itemize}


\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Examples}.  Every numbered Example, in the sections we covered, is fair game, as are closely-related examples.  Every question on the homework Assignments 1--4, of the form ``provide an example (with these properties),'' is fair game, as are closely-related examples.
