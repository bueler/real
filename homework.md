## Homework Assignments

Each homework Assignment has its own template.  The links below are in reverse chronological order.  The [Schedule](assets/general/F25/schedule.pdf) also shows the due dates.

Start each assignment by downloading the .tex LaTeX source file.  Change the filename by replacing with your last name; mine would be "A1-Bueler.tex".  Open it in an editor or in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), etc.

Once you are editing the .tex, replace the YOUR NAME HERE with your full name.  Then read the comments in the .tex file to understand the questions being asked, and to find any hints that I might give.  Then fill in the various parts.

Assignments are **due by the start of class on the day given**.  Please turn in each Assignment by uploading both of the completed .tex and .pdf files to the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/27104).

After each Assignment is due, solutions will be posted at the **Modules tab** of the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/27104).
